- Access page attributes like:
  - `.url`
  - `.references`
  - `.images`

- Extract tables using:
  - HTML content
  - `pandas.read_html()`

### Key Understanding

- Wikipedia library abstracts HTML complexity.
- It provides structured access to knowledge data.
- Tables on Wikipedia are stored as lists.
- Sometimes trial-and-error is required to select the correct table index.

### Practical Outcome

## GitHub Actions – Scheduling & Automation

Core Learning:
GitHub Actions allows automation of workflows based on events such as push, pull request, or schedule (cron).

Key Concepts Learned:

• Workflows must be inside `.github/workflows/`
• YAML syntax is used to define jobs and triggers
• Cron expressions define time-based execution
• All schedules run in UTC timezone
• GitHub does NOT guarantee exact execution timing

Cron Structure:
Minute Hour Day Month Day-of-week

Example:
*/5 * * * *
Runs every 5 minutes.

Important Insight:
Even if you schedule something every 5 minutes, GitHub may delay execution due to internal queueing. Therefore, scheduled workflows should NOT be used for real-time monitoring.

Practical Applications:
• Automated deployments
• Dependency scanning
• Security checks
• Monthly reports
• Periodic backups

Major Takeaway:
Automation is powerful but must be designed with execution delays in mind.

## Screen Scraping with Gemini – Vision-Based Data Extraction

Core Learning:
Instead of scraping HTML using BeautifulSoup or Selenium, we can record screen content and let a multimodal LLM extract structured information from image frames.

Technical Insights:

• Recording at 1 frame per second converts each second into an analyzable image.
• Gemini processes video as sequential frames.
• Each frame costs tokens (~250 tokens/image).
• JSON mode must be enabled for structured output.
• This method relies on computer vision instead of DOM parsing.

Cost Efficiency:
Even 1000 frames cost only a few cents, making this scalable.

Advantages:
• Works on dynamic websites
• Bypasses HTML structure complexity
• Handles JavaScript-rendered content
• No need for browser automation

Limitations:
• Depends on visible content
• May skip content if scrolling too fast
• Not ideal for high-speed scraping

Major Insight:
We are increasingly better at vision-based extraction using AI than writing custom scraping logic.

Shift Observed:
Code-based automation → Vision-based automation

Why Markdown?
• Lightweight
• Human-readable
• Platform-independent
• Easy to chunk for embeddings
• Ideal for RAG pipelines

Modes of Operation:

A) Without LLM
• Direct parsing
• Fast conversion
• Works for PDFs and structured documents

B) With LLM

Key Insight:
Data preprocessing is foundational for LLM performance.

Applications:
• Preparing enterprise documents
• Cleaning PDFs
• Knowledge base preparation
• Dataset generation
• RAG system pipelines

Comparison Insight:
MarkItDown is promising, but tools like Docling are currently more mature.

Major Takeaway:
Unstructured data must be standardized before feeding into AI systems.

Applications:
• Mapping applications
• Location analytics
• Delivery systems
• Geo-tagging datasets
• Urban planning

Major Takeaway:
Unstructured address text → Structured geographic intelligence.

# DocSearch Scraping Tutorial

### 1. Semantic Search vs Keyword Search
- Keyword search matches exact words.
- Semantic search uses embeddings to find meaning.
- Scraped data enabled building a semantic proof-of-concept search engine.

---

### 2. Caching is Critical During Development

The `cached_get()` pattern:
- Saves HTML responses locally.
- Prevents re-downloading on every run.
- Makes debugging dramatically faster.
- Allows safe interruption and resume.

Core idea:
- If cached file exists → load from disk.
- Else → fetch, save, then return.

This reflects the principle:
> Laziness, impatience, and hubris are programmer virtues.

---

### 3. Scraping Strategy

Scraping process must be broken into stages:

1. Get archive page URLs.
2. Extract article links.
3. Deduplicate links.
4. Fetch article pages.
5. Parse structured content.
6. Store structured output.

Small correct steps > Big complex logic.

---

### 4. XPath > Guesswork

Using browser DevTools:
- Inspect elements
- Identify stable container divs
- Avoid sidebars, popups, widgets
- Use `contains()` in XPath instead of exact class matching

Trial and error is normal.

---

### 5. Debugging Techniques (Top 3)

#### Print Liberally
Print variables frequently to confirm expectations.

#### Use Breakpoints
Use `breakpoint()` or debugger to inspect variables when confused.

#### Rubber Ducking
Explain the problem clearly (to a person or LLM).
Often clarity emerges during explanation itself.

---

### 6. Use LLMs Properly

Two modes:
- Ask implementation questions (e.g., how to use httpx)
- Ask troubleshooting strategy questions

Important:
- Be specific.
- Mention preferred libraries.
- Ask for short, readable code.

---

### 7. Proof of Concept > Presentation

A working demo:
- Converts clients faster than slides.
- Shows capability instantly.
- Enables rapid production deployment.

Portfolio > Certificates.

---

### 8. Save Incrementally

Write output JSON inside loop.
Benefits:
- Inspect progress early.
- Build next system phase without waiting for completion.
- Avoid losing hours of scraping.

---

### 9. Handle Edge Cases

Real-world scraping requires:
- Redirect handling
- Empty responses
- HTTP 200 with empty content
- Class name mismatches
- Deduplication

Expect imperfections.

---

## Broader Insight

- Small experiments can win major opportunities.
- Rapid prototyping changes competitive advantage.
- Technical curiosity + structured thinking = leverage.

# Scraping PDFs

### 1. Extracting PDFs from Webpages

- Use BeautifulSoup to parse HTML.
- Extract anchor tags.
- Filter links ending in ".pdf".
- Use string split to extract filename:
  link.split("/")[-1]

This allows automated downloading of multiple PDFs from a single page.

---

### 2. Handling File Storage

- Create folder if not exists.
- Use Google Drive (Colab) or local directory.
- Write PDF in binary mode.

Automation avoids manual downloading of 25–30 documents.

---

### 3. Reading Tables from PDFs

Tabula library:
- Works similar to pandas.read_csv
- Uses read_pdf()

Example:
- pages=18 → extracts only page 18
- pages="all" → extracts all tables

---

### 4. Problem: Extra Content in Table Extraction

Issue:
- Tabula detected multiple sections as tables.
- Page layout (landscape formatting) caused misinterpretation.
- Non-table content included.

Example:
- Newcastle United "125 years" text extracted unintentionally.
- Logos ignored (image content not parsed).

---

### 5. Solution: Area Parameter

Tabula allows:
area=[top, left, bottom, right]

This:
- Restricts extraction to specific region.
- Removes unwanted content.
- Produces clean structured table.

This is critical for precise PDF parsing.

---

### 6. Direct CSV Conversion

Using:
convert_into()

Benefits:
- Directly outputs CSV file.
- Reduces manual post-processing.
- Faster pipeline from PDF → structured data.

---

## Practical Insights

- PDF scraping is different from HTML scraping.
- Layout matters significantly.
- Always inspect extracted DataFrame before saving.
- Fine-tuning extraction region improves accuracy.

---

## Broader Learning

PDF scraping workflow:

Webpage → PDF download → Table extraction → Cleaning → CSV export

This pipeline is useful for:
- Financial reports
- Government documents
- Sports analytics
- Research publications

Automating PDF table extraction saves hours of manual work.
